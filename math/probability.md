# The frequently used equation

### Addition equation
$$ P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB) $$

### Conditional probability equation, this comes from the definiton.
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(AB)}{P(B)} \, and \, P(B|A)= \frac{P(AB)}{P(A)}$$

### Bayes Equation
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)} $$

Proven of Bayes Equation

According to conditional probability (check equation 2):

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\because \, P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) \\
\therefore \, P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

1. If $B \subset A$, wchich one is correct?

A. $P(\overline{AB}) = 1-P(A)$

B. $P(\bar{B}-\bar{A}) = P(\bar{B}) - P(\bar{A})$

C. $P(B|A) = P(B)$

D. $P(A|\bar{B})=P(A)$


2. If $P(B)>0, A_1A_2=\emptyset$, which one of below is wrong?

A. $P(A_1A_2|B) = 0$

B. $P(A_1\cup A_2|B) = P(A_1|B)+P(A_2|B)$

C. $P(\bar A_1\bar A_2|b)=1$

D. $P(\bar A_1 \cup \bar A_2|B)=1$

3. We know $P(A)=\frac{1}{4}, P(B|A)=1/3, P(A|B)=1/2$, then $P(A \cup B)'s value

A. 5/12

B. 1/6

C. 1/3

D. 1/8

4. There are 4 disqualified product in 10. Takes 2 from them and 1 of them is disqualified. What is the probability of antoher one is also disqualified?

5. There are 5 white and 6 black ball.  Take 3 from them and they are all black's posibility

6.If A, B has and only has 1 happen is 0.3. P(A)=0.2 and P(B)=0.3. THen P(B|A)
