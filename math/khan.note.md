1. [Probability in normal density curves
](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/sampling-distribution-ap/xfb5d8e68:the-normal-distribution-revisited/e/probability-normal-density-curves)

* One tail test and two tail test: 
 The alternative hypothesis is one direction or two direction. The direction means the hypothesis is using words like better or worse, etc. The two direction means the hypothesis is using words like different, etc
 
  For example, suppose you want to test whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug. If the alternative hypothesis states that the new drug is more effective, you would use a one-tailed test. If the alternative hypothesis states that the new drug is simply different from the existing drug, you would use a two-tailed test
$$
\bar x = 150 \\
sd = 20 \\
\sigma = \frac{\sqrt{\sum (x-\bar x)^2}}{N}\\

z-score = (175-150)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25 \\
The\  z-score table is 0.8925 \\
So\  Pr(175) = 1 - 0.8925 = 0.1075

2. [Interpret results of simulations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/randomness-probability-simulation/e/interpreting-results-simulations)

* 6*1+4*2+3*1+5*2+6*2+7*1+8*3+10*2+(11+12+13+17+18+20+23+26+28)

    = 6+8+3+10+12+7+24+20+168

    = 90 + 168

    = 258
